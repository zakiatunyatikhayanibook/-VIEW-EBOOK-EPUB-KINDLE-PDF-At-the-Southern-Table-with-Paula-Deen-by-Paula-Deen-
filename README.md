Review: I saw this book at a Paula Deen restaurant while on vacation but with keeping weight in mind - I ordered on here instead! This made it so I didn’t have to haul it home in my luggage. The price was better than I would have paid at the restaurant (not autographed but I’m ok with that). The recipes are so delicious and the book is all in full color and lots of pictures. Would make a great addition to any cook’s cookbook library. Can’t wait to try more of these recipes!
